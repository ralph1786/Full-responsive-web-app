# Full-responsive-web-app
Very responsive web application.  It consists of using the css framework bootstrap 4.
Noticed the style.css file was very long, in order to make it easier for anyone reading it was separated into two css files.
The new file called style2.css contains all of the media queries.
In addition fixed a small bug where the navbar would not stay fixed at the top throughout the entire page.
